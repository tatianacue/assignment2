2. 8 commits were done in total to the repository. I used git shortlog to get this information.

3. The README file was last modified on the date Thu Feb 22 13:56:20 2024 -0500. To get this information
I did git log README.md

4. Two reasons branches are using in Git repositories are to add new features without affecting the main branch,
and to fix a bug without affecting the main branch.

5. Git log shows the committed history while git status gives you the info about the files in
your working directory at the current state.

6. I used git log --follow Vehicle.h to see commits with "Vehicle.h"

7. I used git log --grep="file" to see commit messages containing "file"

(I) In OOP, inheritance is when a child/subclass inherits attributes and methods from the parent class.
(II) In OOP, polymorphism allows methods to do different things depending on the object it's on.
(III) In OOP, encapsulation is wrapping the data and methods in one unit, which limits direct access to some of that data.

9. The main difference between the two workflows is that the dictator and lietenants workflow has two levels of conflict management 
with the dictator and lieutenant repositories, while the integration workflow conflict is handled by just the integration manager.

10. A team of 100 developers would benefit more from a dictator and lieutenant workflow over a centralized one because then developers
don't have to rely solely on managing the conflicts themselves. Since there are probably a lot of conflicts because its a large team, more
oversight is provided with the two levels of management. A lieutenant can oversee and make sure conflicts are resolved, and the
dictator can also manage another layer of conflicts.
